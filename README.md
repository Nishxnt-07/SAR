# SAR Change Detection with UNet
This repository contains a deep learning model for **change detection** in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using the **UNet architecture**. The model is designed to identify changes in the environment by analyzing SAR images captured at different times.
## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- **sar_change_detection_unet.zip**: Contains the trained UNet model and associated files for change detection tasks.
## ðŸ§  Model Overview
The UNet model is a convolutional neural network designed for semantic segmentation tasks. It has an encoder-decoder structure that captures context and enables precise localization, making it ideal for pixel-wise change detection in SAR images.
## ðŸš€ Usage
1. **Extract the ZIP file**: Unzip `sar_change_detection_unet.zip` to access the model files.
2. **Load the Model**: Use a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch to load the UNet model.
3. **Prepare Input Data**: Ensure your SAR images are preprocessed and formatted correctly for the model.
4. **Run Inference**: Pass the input images through the model to obtain change detection results.
## ðŸ”§ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NumPy
- OpenCV (for image processing)
